# eQTL_GTMTM
**G**enome-wide and **T**ranscriptome-wide **M**ixed-layered **T**ensor **M**odeling (GTMTM)

We will do tissue-specific linear factor modeling and tensor modeling, all conditional on cis- direct linear modeling

This is done with TensorFlow


Dummy1 tested the simple multi-layer linear model, with the hidden layer as the intermediate variables
Dummy2 tested the multi-layer directed graph, and we have the hidden layer as hidden variables to be inferred
